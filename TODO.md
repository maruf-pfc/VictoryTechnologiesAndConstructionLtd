# 📝 VTCLBD Implementation Roadmap & TODO Tracker

This file tracks the completed, ongoing, and pending features of the Victory Technologies and Construction Ltd (VTCLBD) platform.

## 🟩 COMPLETED FEATURES

*   **🔒 Auth System & Session Management**:
    *   JWT-based registration, login, and profile fetching.
    *   Persistent Zustand store (`auth.store.ts`) for auth tokens.
    *   Axios dynamic interceptor invalidating tokens strictly on expiration (preventing false logouts).
*   **📂 Multi-stage Docker Containerization**:
    *   Production-ready frontend and backend Dockerfiles.
    *   `docker-compose.yml` leveraging local `.env` variables to avoid credential leakage.
    *   Root `.gitignore` ignoring `.env` and local caches.
*   **📜 Automated Certificate Issuance**:
    *   Auto-generation of certificate records once progress hits 100%.
    *   High-resolution fallback mock template for visual elegance.
    *   Exclusively enrolled course certificate listings.
*   **📦 Backend REST API**:
    *   EF Core schema definitions with seeded Admin (`admin@vtclbd.com` / `Admin@123`) and Student (`student@vtclbd.com` / `Student@123`) accounts.
    *   Dynamic cascading deletion of users (`DeleteUserAsync` in `UserService.cs`) that cleans enrollments, progress, and payment records without violating relational integrity.
*   **💻 Admin CRUD Overlays**:
    *   Unified frosted-glass fullscreen modal setup for Courses, Projects, and CMS blocks to eliminate scrolling.
*   **⛓️ CI/CD Workflows**:
    *   GitHub Actions configuration validating Next.js frontend, dotnet solution builds, and dry-running Docker configurations.
