## 📦 Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v22+) or Bun
*   .NET 10.0 SDK
*   PostgreSQL running locally (or via Docker)

### 1. Setting Up the Database & Backend
1.  Navigate to the `server/VTCLBD.API` folder.
2.  Set up your local Connection String inside `appsettings.json` (or `.env.local`):
    ```json
    "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=vtclbd_academy;Username=postgres;Password=yourpassword"
    }
    ```
3.  Apply entity migrations and seed initial demo data:
    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    ```
4.  Run the API server:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
    *The API will be available at `http://localhost:5237`.*

### 2. Setting Up the Frontend
1.  Navigate to the `client` directory.
2.  Create a `.env.local` file:
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5237/api
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    bun install
    ```
4.  Launch the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    bun run dev
    ```
    *Open `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the platform.*

## 🐳 Docker Deployment & Orchestration

The application is fully containerized using multi-stage build files. To protect sensitive credentials, all connection parameters, database passwords, and secrets are read from a local `.env` file instead of being exposed inside the Compose file.

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```env
    # Database Configurations
    DB_NAME=vtclbd_academy
    DB_USER=vtclbd_admin
    DB_PASSWORD=vtclbd_secure_password_2026

    # JWT Security Credentials
    JWT_KEY=VTCLBD_SuperSecretPremiumJWTKey_2026_SecureSecurityKey
    JWT_ISSUER=VTCLBD
    JWT_AUDIENCE=VTCLBD_Students

    # API Endpoint Configurations
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5237/api
    ```

2.  Launch the entire stack seamlessly with a single command:
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build -d
    ```

### Docker Services Exposed
*   **Frontend client**: `http://localhost:3000`
*   **Backend server**: `http://localhost:5237`
*   **PostgreSQL DB**: `localhost:5432`

## 🛡️ Default Seeded Accounts

The database comes fully populated with rich demo courses, modules, videos, projects, and CMS blocks. Log in with the following default credentials to test:

| Role | Username / Email | Password |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Administrator** | `admin@vtclbd.com` | `Admin@123` |
| **Student** | `student@vtclbd.com` | `Student@123` |

## ⚙️ CI/CD Workflow Pipeline

A robust, production-grade GitHub Actions pipeline is active on push/PR to main branches. The steps validated automatically are:
1.  **Backend CI**: Restores dependencies, builds target files in release mode, and runs unit tests.
2.  **Frontend CI**: Installs modules, runs eslint checkups, and validates Next.js static builds.
3.  **Docker Dry Run**: Executes build steps for both backend and frontend Dockerfiles to ensure zero compilation drift.
